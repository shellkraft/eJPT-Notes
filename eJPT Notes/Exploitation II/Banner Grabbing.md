+ Banner grabbing is an information gathering technique used by penetration testers to enumerate information regarding the target operating system as well as the services that are running on its open ports.

+ The primary objective of banner grabbing is to identify the service running on a specific port as well as the service version.

+ Banner grabbing can be performed through various techniques:
	+ Performing a service version detection scan with Nmap.
	+ Connecting to the open port with Netcat.
	+ Authenticating with the service (If the service supports authentication), for example; SSH, FTP, Telnet etc. 

### Banner grabbing with `nmap`

1. Perform a service version and OS detection scan with `nmap`.
```
nmap -sV -O <ip>
```

2. Using `banner` script in `nmap` to perform banner grabbing.
```
nmap -sV --script=banner <ip>
```

### Using `netcat` to perform Banner Grabbing

1. We can further enumerate an open port
