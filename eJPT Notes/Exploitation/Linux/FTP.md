- FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a protocol that uses TCP port 21 and is used to facilitate file sharing between a server and client/clients.

- It is also frequently used as a means of transferring files to and from the directory of a web server.

- FTP authentication requires a username and password combination. As a result, we can perform a brute-force attack on the FTP server in order to identify legitimate credentials.

- In some cases, FTP servers may be configured to allow anonymous access, which consequently allows anyone to access to the FTP server without providing any legitimate credentials.
