- Kernel exploits on Linux will typically target vulnerabilities In the Linux kernel to execute arbitrary code in order to run privileged system commands or to obtain a system shell.

- This process will differ based on the Kernel version and distribution being targeted and the kernel exploit being used.

- Privilege escalation on Linux systems will typically follow the following methodology:
	+ Identifying kernel vulnerabilities
	+ Downloading, compiling and transferring kernel exploits onto the target system

### Tools and Environments

- Linux-Exploit-Suggester - This tool is designed to assist in detecting security deficiencies for given Linux kernel/Linux-based machine. It assesses (using heuristics methods) the exposure of the given kernel on every publicly known Linux kernel exploit.

*Kernel exploits are risky to run. If we run a kernel exploit on target kernel which isn't compatible, it can cause kernel crashes or kernel panics.*

### How to exploit ?

1. Get initial access to the target.

2. Open a `shell` session
	- Type `shell`. 
	- Open `bash` session. Type - `/bin/bash -i`

3. Check the users in the system. `cat /etc/passwd`

4. Download the `linux-exploit-suggester` script with the quick download command in the repository. 
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester/master/linux-exploit-suggester.sh -O les.sh
```

5. Navigate to the Linux Temp directory. `cd /tmp`
 
6. Upload the `les.sh` shell script using `meterpreter` and switch back to the `shell` session.

7. Give `les.sh` executable permissions `chmod +x les.sh` and run it. `./les.sh`

8.
