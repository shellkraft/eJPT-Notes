+ A client-side attack is an attack vector that involves coercing a client to execute a malicious payload on their system that consequently connects back to the attacke when executed.

+ Client-side attacks typically utilize various social engineering techniques like generating malicious documents or portable executables (PEs).

+ Client-side attacks take advantage of human vulnerabilities as opposed to vulnerabilities in services or software running on the target system.

+ Given that this attack vector involves the transfer and storage of a malicious payload on the client's system (disk), attackers need to be cognisant of AV detection.
