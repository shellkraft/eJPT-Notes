+ We can dump Linux user hashes with the hashdump post exploitation module.

+ Linux password hashes are stored in the `/etc/shadow` file and can only be accessed by the root user or a user with root privileges.

+ The hashdump module can be used to dump the user account hashes from the `/etc/shadow` file and can also be used to unshadow the hashes for password cracking with John the Ripper.

### How to dump hashes ?

1. Gain initial access. 

2. Upgrade the session to a meterpreter session.

3. Now we'll perform hash dump.
```
use post/linux/gather/hashdump
```
- The unshadowed passwd file will be saved in loot.
- The hashes might not be visible for all users, in that case, change the password of that user using `passwd` and perform hash dump again.

4. We can create a new user.
```
useradd -m <username> -s /bin/bash
```
