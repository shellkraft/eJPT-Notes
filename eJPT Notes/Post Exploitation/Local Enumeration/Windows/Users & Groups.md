### Enumerating Users & Groups 

+ After gaining initial access to a target system, it is always important to learn more about the system like, what user account you have access to and other user accounts on the system.

+ What are we looking for?
	+ Current user & privileges
	+ Additional user information
	+ Other users on the system
	+ Groups
	+ Members of the built-in administrator group

### How to enumerate ?

1. Gain initial access.

2. We can use `getprivs` command in the meterpreter shell to get the privileges of the current user.

3. Using `MSF` module to get all the information pertinent to the users currently logged on or the ones who have previously logged on. To use this, background the current session.
```
use post/windows/gather/enum_logged_on_users
```

4. We can get privileges of the current user manually using the target's shell too.
```
whoami /privs
```

5. Use `query user` in the Windows command shell to check the currently logged on users. 

6. To enumerate all the users in the system, we can use `net users`

7. We can learn more about a particular user using `net user <username>`

8.
